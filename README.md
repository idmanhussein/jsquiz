On a few of the questions, when it goes over more than 1 line, the answers encroach upon the buttons underneath. The div they are in needs to be taller. What it should really do is, as the text gets deeper down the page, it should resize the div it is in. This would also make it reactive to screensize. For eg. if you make the height of the div in the css using percentages instead of pixels

The buttons aren't entirely clickable. You have to move your mouse to the bottom of it to click it.
